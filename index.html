    The goal of this project was to create an interactive map in Mapbox, and a data visualisation in Adobe Illustrator that represents two datasets and their relationship. The datasets I chose were from the City of Vancouverâ€™s Open Data Portal. The first one contained the locations of graffiti across the city, and the second one contained the locations of schools across the city. Upon observing the raw data, I noticed that both the datasets specified which region the graffiti and schools are located. In order to better organise and represent the information, I decided to analyse the data in relation to each region of Vancouver. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I began by taking the data sets into Microsoft Excel, and hiding the columns that were unnecessary to the analysis I wanted to conduct. I then created pivot tables demonstrating counts of schools and graffiti in each region. After gathering the counts, I placed the data side-by-side to observe any correlations. I also created a simple tree map to visualise the number of schools in each region, so I could get a better idea of the differences between each region. After this, I began the process of creating a map in Mapbox. I uploaded the datasets and highlighted each region with different opacities depending on the number of schools in the region. To support further analysis about the proximity between schools and graffiti occurrences, I pinpointed the locations of schools across Vancouver, and labelled the schools by name. Then, I created an infographic in Adobe Illustrator to represent the amount of graffiti and the amount of schools in each region of Vancouver. The infographic is designed to resemble graffiti sprayed across a brick wall, and the fonts used for the title and regions support this aesthetic. I downloaded these fonts from <a href="https://www.dafont.com/">dafont.com</a> The infographic follows a format similar to a tree map, but with the added detail that each brick on the wall represents one school. The neighbourhoods are represented by different brick clusters, outlined in white. Each cluster is overlaid with a different shade of grey depending on how much graffiti is in the region. I kept the whole infographic grayscale to avoid confusion, as viewers could think that colours correlate to the data in some way.

    While looking at the map and graphic, I observed some trends. Firstly, as you look further North, the graffiti becomes more concentrated, and as you look further North-East, the schools become more concentrated (with some exceptions). The majority of graffiti seems to be concentrated near Gastown, Strathcona and Mount Pleasant. This could be a mild correlation, or it could simply be due to an increase in population, it may not necessarily represent a relationship between schools and graffiti. Secondly, there is barely any graffiti in or near park areas of the city. This could be because of a decrease in walls and surfaces to graffiti. Finally, there tend to be clusters of graffiti in close proximity to most of the schools when observed individually. When looking at the areas with sparser graffiti, areas with high schools or colleges nearby appeared to have more clusters of graffiti, which makes sense, as elementary school students are likely too young to have access to graffiti materials. Further analysis regarding the average income, average age, and population size of each region could supplement the observations made about graffiti in Vancouver.
